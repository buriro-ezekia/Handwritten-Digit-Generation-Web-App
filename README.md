# Handwritten-Digit-Generation-Web-App

Build a web application using a framework like Streamlit that generates 5 images of a user-specified handwritten digit (0-9) using a deep learning model trained from scratch on the MNIST dataset with PyTorch or TensorFlow. The application should be publicly accessible for at least two weeks.
